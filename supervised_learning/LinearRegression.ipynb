    "## What is Linear Regression?\n",
    "Linear regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It works by:\n",
    "1. Finding the best-fitting line through the data points\n",
    "2. Minimizing the mean squared error between predictions and actual values\n",
    "3. Providing continuous value predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Task\n",
    "We'll use linear regression to predict EA FC 24 player market values based on their attributes. This regression task will demonstrate how we can estimate continuous values (market prices) based on player statistics."
