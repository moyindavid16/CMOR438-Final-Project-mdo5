# EA FC 24 Player Analysis Project

This project implements various machine learning algorithms to analyze EA FC 24 player data. The project is structured into three main components: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and custom ML implementations.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Contains dataset loading and processing utilities
- `supervised_learning/` - Implementation of various supervised learning algorithms
- `unsupervised_learning/` - Implementation of clustering algorithms
- `my_ml/` - Custom implementations of machine learning algorithms

## Dataset

The project uses the EA Sports FC 24 Complete Player Dataset from Kaggle, which includes:
- Basic player information (name, age, club, nationality)
- Player attributes (pace, shooting, passing, etc.)
- Position-specific ratings
- Market value and contract details

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Required packages: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
